# KMeans_Algorithm
Code to run a k-means algorithm on each frame of a video to find the dominant colors, then write the dominant colors to an image/video.

Running it with v0.1 is simple, and I just realized that my home directory structure is hard-coded into the source code. Look like nobody can run this unless their linux user folder is named tess. Oh well.
