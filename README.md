Stands for "Video Handler and Simplifier" because I liked the acronym and desparately wanted three words that were somewhat relevant. Takes a video file as an input, runs a kmeans algorithm on it to determine the dominant colors. Then draws the dominant color, proportionate to how dominant they are, into a 640x480 video. Once finished, it plays the original video and the simplified video at the same time so you can see, in real time, the dominant colors of every frame.
